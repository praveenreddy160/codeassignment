PROGRAMMING TEST

====================

Please use the attached two documents along with the instructions given to write your program in

any language you prefer and any tools you wish to choose. Do not limit yourself to any time limit,

but try to do an error free code.

 

 

Command:

python program1.py # for executing first program
python program2.py # for executing second program 




The candidate may use whatever programming language or tools they prefer. Ideally, they should create a

small github repo for their solution and share it with me.

Developer Challenge

In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data. Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).
 

The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League. The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.
